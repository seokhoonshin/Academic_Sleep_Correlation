# Sleep and Academic Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates the correlation between sleep habits and academic performance among university students. Using statistical and data analysis techniques, the study explores how factors such as sleep duration, sleep quality, stress levels, and caffeine consumption influence students' final grades.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To determine the correlation between sleep duration and academic performance.
2. To analyze the impact of sleep quality (deep vs. light sleep) on academic outcomes.
3. To evaluate how stress and anxiety affect the relationship between sleep and grades.
4. To assess the effect of consistent vs. irregular sleep schedules on academic performance.
5. To explore the role of caffeine consumption in the sleep-academic performance relationship.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on multiple datasets:
1. [StatCrunch Dataset - Sleep and GPA](https://www.statcrunch.com/reports/view?reportid=23762&tab=preview)
2. [PNAS Dataset - Sleep Duration and GPA](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2209123120)
3. [StatCrunch Report - Sleep and Academic Performance](https://www.statcrunch.com/reports/view?reportid=31860&tab=preview)

The datasets include variables such as:
- Sleep hours and quality
- GPA scores
- Stress/anxiety levels
- Caffeine consumption
- Demographic details (gender, age)

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling missing data, and standardizing labels.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing sleep patterns, GPA distributions, and other correlations.
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Correlation coefficients (e.g., between sleep duration and GPA).
   - Hypothesis testing for differences in means (e.g., deep vs. light sleep).
   - Regression models to predict GPA based on sleep-related factors.
4. **Visualization Tools:** Plotting relationships using Python libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Hypotheses
The project addresses the following hypotheses:
1. Sleep duration is significantly correlated with university final grades.
2. Sleep quality influences academic performance.
3. Stress and anxiety mediate the relationship between sleep and grades.
4. Consistent sleep schedules are associated with better academic outcomes.
5. Caffeine consumption impacts the sleep-academic performance relationship.

## Results
- Initial findings indicate a positive correlation between consistent sleep schedules and higher GPA.
- Students who reported deeper sleep tended to perform better academically.
- Excessive caffeine consumption showed a negative impact on sleep quality and GPA.
